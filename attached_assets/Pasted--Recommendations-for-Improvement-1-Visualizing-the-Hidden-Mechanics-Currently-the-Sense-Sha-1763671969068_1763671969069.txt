💡 Recommendations for Improvement
1. Visualizing the "Hidden" Mechanics Currently, the "Sense → Share → Process → Act" loop is mentioned in text but abstracted away in the gameplay. Learners might treat the cards as "magic stat boosters."

Recommendation: When a card is clicked or hovered, trigger a visual diagram overlay showing where that specific technology fits in the loop.

Why: This connects the abstract strategy to the concrete technical architecture described in the readings.

2. The "Disaster" Scenario (Consequence Severity) The current feedback for high risk is text-based ("Security concerns are emerging").

Recommendation: If Complexity > 80, introduce a critical failure event in Round 3 (e.g., "Ransomware attack: -20 Efficiency").

Why: Learning science suggests that emotional resonance (shock/surprise) improves retention. A mild text warning is easily ignored; a metric penalty is remembered.

3. Pre-Mortem Reflection Before the "Final Summary," add a specific "Pre-Mortem" prompt.

Recommendation: Between Round 3 and the Summary, ask: "What is the biggest risk currently facing your facility?" (Multiple choice: Security, Inefficiency, Environmental Fine).

Why: This forces Metacognition. Users must evaluate their own strategy before the system tells them the answer, leading to deeper encoding of the lesson.

4. Archetype Nuance The archetypes are binary (Efficiency vs. Sustainability).

Recommendation: Ensure the "Balanced Architect" archetype doesn't feel like the "boring average." Reframe it as the "Resilient Operator" to reward users who successfully managed the trade-offs, as this is the actual learning goal.

5. Reinforce the "Digital Twin" Concept Digital Twins are complex. The game treats them as just another card.

Recommendation: When the "Digital Twin" card is played, visual feedback should ideally show the other cards "connecting" to it.

Why: This reinforces that a Digital Twin isn't just a sensor; it's an aggregator of other sensors.

Summary
The tool is pedagogically sound and avoids the common pitfall of being "just a quiz." With the technical fixes to preventing metric runaway and the addition of higher-stakes consequences for the "Risk" metric, this will be a robust application and synthesis exercise.
